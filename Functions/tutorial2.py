    Again keeping with the format of:
        - Library imports
        - Function init
        - Calling functions
'''
# import libraries
import time     # example import

'''
    Here you can also set variables that can be used anywhere in this script.
    This isn't a pretty good style to use but and it is usually better to keep
    everything localised in functions. There will be an example of that later.
'''	
# list module variables - if needed but not recommended
anotherTest = "another test"

'''
    Here we will create a skeleton function to start off.
    This function takes one parameter which will be listed in
    between the ()
'''
# write functions
def parameter_function(anotherTest):
    print anotherTest
    
# call functions
parameter_function(anotherTest)     # call function with the parameter listed

'''
    Expected output: another test
